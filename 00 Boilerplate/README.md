# 00 Boilerplate

In this sample we are going to setup the basic plumbing to "build" our project and launch it in a dev server.

## We are going to use:

- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
- [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## The most interesting parts worth to take a look

- package.json: check packages installed.

- webpack.config.js: check the build process and ts-loader to handle typescript.

- src: javascript using imports.
